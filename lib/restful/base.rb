      ACTIONS = [:index, :show, :edit, :update, :new, :create, :destroy]

      ##
      # Restful is the macro that setup a controller to become restful.
      # This macro accepts 3 params:
      #
      # ==== Params
      # * model: A required parameter which is a symbol of the model name.
      # * route_prefix: A prefix string to be used with controller's url
      # helper.
      # * actions: An array of actions that a controller should implement, if
      # none is passed then all seven REST actions are defined.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      # Simple:
      #
      #   class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
      #     include Restful::Base
      #     respond_to :html
      #
      #     restful model: :document
      #   end
      #
      # This definition will create the seven REST actions for Document model,
      # this setup a single object instance variable @document and a collection
      # variable @documents.
      #
      # Route prefix:
      #
      #   class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
      #     include Restful::Base
      #     respond_to :html
      #
      #     restful model: :document, route_prefix: 'admin'
      #   end
      #
      # With *route_prefix* param every URL helper method in our controller
      # will have the defined prefix.
      #
      # `edit_resource_path` helper method will call internally
      # `admin_edit_resource_path`.
      #
      # Listed actions variation:
      #
      # The last parameter *actions* allows you to list in an array the actions
      # that you want your controller to have:
      #
      #   class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
      #     include Restful::Base
      #     respond_to :html
      #
      #     restful model: :document, actions: [:index, :show]
      #   end
      #
      # In this case our controller will only respond to those 2 actions. We
      # can do it the other way, indicate list of actions that shouldn't be
      # defined:
      #
      #   class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
      #     include Restful::Base
      #     respond_to :html
      #
      #     restful model: :document, actions: [:all, except: [:destroy, :show]]
      #   end
      #
      # For this last example all seven REST actions will be defined but
      # :destroy and :show
      #
      # Strong params
      # Restful provides 3 hooks for you to implement in your controller, two
      # of these hooks will be called depending on the action that is being
      # executed: :create_secure_params and :update_secure_params.
      #
      # if you don't require a specific strong params definition for each
      # action, then just implement :secure_params method and this will be
      # called.
      #
      # ==== Considerations
      # From previous examples you must have notice by now that the respond_to
      # macro es need it. This is because all REST actions call the
      # respont_with method, which works with the respond_to macro. Just
      # include it in your controllers and list the formats do you wish your
      # controller to respond.
